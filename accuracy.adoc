#### Configuration steps
[ ] Program all devices with the firmware under test  
[ ] Document which firmware is installed in the manifest    
[ ] Ensure the devices are configured as they will ship to the customer  
[ ] Place fresh batteries in the devices  
[ ] Verify the devices have internet connectivity  
[ ] Record the configuration of the device (firmware + configuration) in the [manifest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JEcHEHqKY9_5Mx8XYi0CrSV7RCmDt_zUmpR6bRVj_nM/edit#gid=0)

#### Test definition
[ ] Define a route for each of the tests  
[ ] Along the route, define 5 places to stop  
[ ] At least 1 of the 5 places to stop **must** be indoors  
[ ] The route should include various speed limits

### Data Analysis
[ ] Download the data for each UE from the data capture test list  
[ ] Verify the data of each UE by  
  [ ] Check the RTTD is valid  
  [ ] Timestamp is valid  
 [ ] Data is parseable  
 [ ] Checksum of data is valid  
 [ ] Verify the serving cell is in the database  
 [ ] If the serving cell is not in the database, record the E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (eCGI) + Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) of the serving cell and the UE-TOKEN of the device in BaseCamp and exclude the payload from the test set  
 [ ] Record statistics on how many payloads are valid  
 [ ] Use the REST API to query locations for the UEs under test  
 [ ] Compare the locations made by the Location Engine to the ground truth GPS log  
 [ ] If the GPS log did not record data within 3 seconds of the location timestamp, discard the payload  
 [ ] Record statistics on how many payloads are discarded due to bad GPS data  
 [ ] Calculate the location error magnitude for each location generated  
 [ ] Record the confidence metric of each location generated  
 [ ] Record statistics on location error magnitude and confidence metrics  
 [ ] Create a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the location error magnitude  
 [ ] Record the 68%, 80%, 95%, 99% and 100% error magnitude percentile  
 [ ] Record yield statistics on how many locations were made, not including data discarded for bad RTTD, no 
 serving cell, or no GPS data  
 [ ] Record yield statistics on how many locations were made overall, including all the discarded data  
 [ ] Create a report of all the recorded values  
 [ ] Include generated plots in the report  
 [ ] Include Google Earth screenshots in the report of test sites (mark GPS, locations, and sequence numbers)  
 [ ] Include an overall Google Earth screenshot of all the data generated during the test  
 [ ] Include a time series graph indicating location error vs time  
 [ ] Post the report to BaseCamp  
 [ ] Post the 68%, 80%, 95%, 99% and 100% error magnitude percentile to BaseCamp  
 [ ] Verify the error magnitudes do not exceed the thresholds for the environment  
 [ ] Post to BaseCamp whether or not the test passed or failed
